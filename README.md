# green-notes

## Description
This project is to create a note taking application that you can write and save notes. This application with save/retreive note data from a json file using a back end technology express.js. This project began with starter code and I created a serve.js folder. In the server.js folder I pulled in the packages I would require like express, uuid, path, util, and fs. I used app.use, app.get, app.delete, and app.post to setup parsing through json, static file, routes, deletes, and let the client know the post request was received. This application was also deployed to Heroku.
